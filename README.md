# C. Bray Ellison

This repository has been updated with PDF And DOCX formats of my resume. The PDF file was created in LaTeX using an open source template and class file with some modifications. Please see the project at [brayellison/Data-Engineer-Resume-LaTeX](https://github.com/brayellison/Data-Engineer-Resume-LaTeX) if you're interested in using it.
